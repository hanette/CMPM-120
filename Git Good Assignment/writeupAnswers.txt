The open source project seems to resolve their pull requests through numbering their commit to keep track of the number of changes, submit an "issue" aka suggestions or branch and submit code changes which are seen as a pull request. The owner of the repository/project will determine which suggestion or changes to take. Most source file wrote in their README about what their expectations are on contribution and asks them to fill out the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Most of the contributions are well organized and are very well constructed showing that they expect high quality contributions. Some repository communicate with the rest of the teams by leaving commit notes, filing new issues, feature requests, and suggestions through GitHub issues. The project are organized through files of where plugins, scripts, examples, etc. are placed while leaving the code of conducts and README in the beginning of the master branch.
